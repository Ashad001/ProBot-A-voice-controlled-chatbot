# Probot: A Chatbot for FAST's Procom Event
Probot is a chatbot designed to answer frequently asked questions about FAST's university locations and guide people about the Procom event. Probot is built using sklearn's neural networks and NLTK. In addition to answering questions, Probot also tells jokes and provides additional information about the event.

### Features
* Provides information about FAST's university locations
* Guides people about Procom event, including types of events, dates, and locations
* Tells jokes to keep the conversation light-hearted
* Uses machine learning to improve responses over time

### Technology Used
Probot is built using Python and deployed using PythonAnywhere. The frontend is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while the backend is built using Flask. The chatbot's machine learning model is built using the scikit-learn library, and the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) is used for processing natural language inputs.

### Deployment
Probot is currently deployed using PythonAnywhere, but it can be deployed to any cloud platform or server that supports Python.

### Future Improvements
In the future, we plan to improve Probot's machine learning model to better understand and respond to natural language inputs. We also plan to add more features, such as the ability to purchase tickets to Procom events through the chatbot.
